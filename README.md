## Welcome to My GitHub Homepage

### Introduction
Hello! I am a student specializing in Medical Informatics with a strong passion for software development. Currently, I am actively seeking a position as a software developer. My GitHub repository showcases some projects I've worked on, demonstrating my skills and interests in the field.

### Projects

#### Image Measure Tool
The Image Measure Tool is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for accurately measuring various aspects of images. Its features include:

- Measuring distances, circumferences, lengths along paths, and angles.
- Catering to diverse applications such as microscopy images, medical imaging (CT and MRI scans), and vtk models.
- Scrollable vtk models, allowing users to navigate through different slices of a chosen axis for detailed analysis.

This tool aims to be versatile and useful across different fields requiring precise image measurements.

#### Machine Learning Notebooks
These Jupyter notebooks were created as part of a module exercise. 
In the first Notebook I implemented a RidgeRegression Model from scratch and explored it's functionality.
In the second one I implemented a MultLayerPerceptron Classifier from scratch and optimized optimization techniques. The results are visualized in Confusion Matrices.
In Progess: SVD, PCA, K-Means, Gaussioan Mixture Models, UMAP

##### How to Use
- Explore each notebook to understand the concepts and techniques applied.
- Code cells are annotated with comments to explain their functionality.
- Markdown cells provide context and insights into the reasoning behind certain decisions.

#### Detecting neurdegenerative Deseases with diffrent ML Models (Pytorch Project)

##### In work, comming soon...
